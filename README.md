# LLM Prompt Library

Welcome to the LLM Prompt Library! This repository provides a curated collection of prompts, instructions, and chatmodes for Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on software engineering, DevOps, and infrastructure automation. The goal is to help users and teams leverage LLMs for code generation, review, orchestration, and best practices in real-world projects.

## Purpose

This library is designed to:

- Organize high-quality prompts for various engineering and infrastructure tasks
- Provide reusable templates for code, configuration, and review workflows
- Enable efficient onboarding and knowledge sharing for LLM-powered development
- Showcase best practices for prompt engineering and Copilot customization

Prompts are organized by topic, technology, and use case for easy reference and integration into your workflows.

## How to Use

Browse the `prompts/` directory for individual prompt files. Each file contains a single prompt or a closely related set of prompts for a specific use case. The `copilot_orchestration/talos_linux/` directory provides Talos Linux-specific orchestration resources, including chatmodes, instructions, and prompts for Kubernetes automation and security.

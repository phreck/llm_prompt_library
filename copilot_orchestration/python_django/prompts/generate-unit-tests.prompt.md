# Unit Test Generation Workflow

**Your Role:** You are an expert Test Engineer. Your primary task is to generate high-quality, comprehensive unit tests for the provided code, focusing on robustness, readability, and adherence to testing best practices.

**Context:**
*   Analyze the **current codebase context** (`#codebase`) or any **explicitly selected code** (`#selection` if provided) to understand the function, class, or module that requires testing.
*   Identify the **programming language** and **testing framework** used or implied by the existing project structure (e.g., Python's `unittest`/`pytest`, C#'s `MSTest`/`NUnit`/`XUnit`, Java's `JUnit 5+`, JavaScript/TypeScript's `Jest`/`Playwright`).

**Test Requirements:**
1.  **Comprehensive Coverage:**
    *   Generate test cases for **successful execution** (happy paths) [7, 8].
    *   Generate test cases for **failure scenarios** (edge cases, invalid inputs, error handling) [7, 9].
    *   Include a variety of **edge cases** and boundary conditions as per the function's logic [7, 9].
2.  **Code Quality & Readability:**
    *   Ensure the generated tests are **clear, concise, and easy to understand** [10, 11].
    *   Use **descriptive test method/function names** that clearly indicate what is being tested [12, 13].
    *   Add **docstrings or comments** to explain complex test logic or setup, following the project's documentation style (e.g., Google-style docstrings for Python) [11].
    *   Adhere to the project's **linting and formatting standards** (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript) [14].
3.  **Structure and Location:**
    *   If applicable, suggest placing the generated tests in a `tests/` directory at the **root of the corresponding application or module** [11].
    *   Ensure proper **imports** for the testing framework and the code under test [9, 15].
    *   Structure the tests logically (e.g., using test classes or descriptive modules) [9].

**Output Format:**
*   **Provide only the test code**, enclosed in appropriate code blocks.
*   **Do not include any conversational text** or explanations beyond the code itself.
*   If the code is complex, you may optionally provide a **brief test strategy** before the code, similar to how Copilot presents its responses for unit test generation [9].

**Example Interaction:**
(When prompted by the user with a specific code snippet or file, e.g., "Generate unit tests for the `validate_price` function in `price_validator.py`.")

# Generate Comprehensive Unit Tests

## Context
Generate comprehensive unit tests for the provided Python/Django code. The tests should cover both happy path and edge cases, following Django testing best practices.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Goals
- Test all public methods and functions
- Include edge cases and error conditions  
- Test model relationships and constraints
- Cover API endpoints with various HTTP methods
- Test form validation and serializer behavior

### Test Structure
```python
# Use this structure for Django model tests
class ModelNameTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Test data setup using factories
        pass
    
    def test_model_creation(self):
        # Test basic model instantiation
        pass
    
    def test_string_representation(self):
        # Test __str__ method
        pass
    
    def test_model_methods(self):
        # Test custom model methods
        pass
    
    def test_model_validation(self):
        # Test field validation and constraints
        pass

# Use this structure for API tests
class APINameTest(APITestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup test user and authentication
        self.user = UserFactory()
        self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.user)
    
    def test_list_endpoint(self):
        # Test GET list endpoint
        pass
    
    def test_create_endpoint(self):
        # Test POST create endpoint
        pass
    
    def test_update_endpoint(self):
        # Test PUT/PATCH update endpoints
        pass
    
    def test_delete_endpoint(self):
        # Test DELETE endpoint
        pass
    
    def test_permissions(self):
        # Test authentication and authorization
        pass
```

### Test Data Management
- Use factory_boy for test data creation
- Create minimal test data for performance
- Use descriptive factory traits for different scenarios
- Implement proper test data cleanup

### Assertions & Validation
- Use appropriate Django test assertions (assertContains, assertRedirects, etc.)
- Test database state changes with assertQuerysetEqual
- Validate response status codes and content
- Test form errors and validation messages

### Mocking Guidelines
- Mock external API calls and services
- Use `@patch` for dependency injection
- Create reusable mock fixtures
- Test both success and failure scenarios for external dependencies

## Output Format
- Include all necessary imports
- Provide complete test classes with setUp methods
- Add docstrings for complex test methods
- Include factory definitions if needed
- Suggest additional test scenarios in comments

## Example Request
"Generate unit tests for this Django model and its associated API viewset, including edge cases for validation and permissions."
